                <h2>Summer Time</h2>
                <p> It was the summer of 1985. My friend David invited me to go to his families propert in the Ozarks. 
                    His father had purchased some property &amp; was starting an RV park. I was exited to go as my friend &amp; I were both avid outdoorsman. 
                    We had big plans to spend the week hunting &amp; fishing.</p>
                <p> The drive down was long &amp; full of unexiting scenery. We played "slug bug" &amp; "I spy" to pass the time. 
                    When we finally arrived, we pulled up to a tiny travel trailer out in the middle of nowhere. "You boys will stay here, while the Mrs. &amp; I stay at a hotel" said Davids father. 
                    This sounded awesome to us. A whole week without any supervision! We couldn't believe it.
                </p>

                <h2>Going to Town</h2>
                <p> On our second day there, we decided to go into town. Now we were both too young to drive, so we decided to set out on foot. 
                    We knew which direction town was in, but we had no idea how far it was. After walking along the creek for what seemed like hours we ran into an older man fishing. 
                    we asked him how far it was to town. He explained that we still have a couple hours walk ahead of us. Undeterred, we marched on.

                <h2>The Swinging Bridge</h2>
                <p> We finally were able to see the town. Walking on the gravel roadway we came to a bridge that had been closed of to traffic. 
                    As we walked across the bridge, it began to sway from side to side. Being that we were the only people on the bridge we began to get scared. 
                    We made it to the other side safely &amp; that is when we saw the sign explaining the swinging bridge. We couldn't believe that cars were once allowed to cross it.

                <h2>Gas Station Pizza</h2>
                <p> After we got to town, we decided to find something to eat. We were hungry from the walk &amp; had a few dollars between us. 
                    We walked through the town looking for a good place to get some food. At the bottom of one of the main streets was a Casey's gas station. 
                    David &amp; I went inside &amp; purchased a couple of slices of pizza. After walking almost 15 miles, that was the best pizza we had ever had.
